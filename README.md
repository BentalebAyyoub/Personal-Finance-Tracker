Let's break down the structure:

1. **`main.py`**: This is the main entry point of your application. It handles user interaction, such as displaying menus, processing user inputs, and calling appropriate functions from other modules.

2. **`authentication.py`**: Contains functions/classes related to user authentication, such as login, registration, and session management. You can use SQLite or any other database system to store user credentials securely.

3. **`transactions.py`**: Defines functions/classes for managing transactions. This module handles adding, categorizing, and retrieving transactions. You can use a CSV file or a database table to store transaction data.

4. **`summary.py`**: Contains functions/classes for generating summaries of income, expenses, and savings over different time periods (e.g., monthly, yearly).

5. **`goals.py`**: Defines functions/classes for setting and tracking financial goals. This module allows users to set goals, track progress, and receive notifications when goals are achieved.

6. **`reports.py`**: Contains functions/classes for generating various types of reports, such as text-based summaries, CSV reports, or graphical charts. You can use libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly for data visualization.

7. **`data/`**: This directory stores data files used by the application. For example, `users.db` can be an SQLite database file for storing user information, and `transactions.csv` can be a CSV file for storing transaction data.

8. **`README.md`**: A markdown file containing information about the project, including its purpose, features, usage instructions, and any dependencies.

This structure provides a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend your project in the future. Each module is responsible for a specific aspect of the application, promoting code reusability and readability. Additionally, using a database for storing user information and transaction data ensures data integrity and persistence across different sessions.
